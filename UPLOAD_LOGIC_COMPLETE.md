# Upload Button Logic & Role-Based Access - Complete ✅

## ✅ **Fixed Upload Button Logic**

### **Upload Project Button**
- **Only appears on `/library` page** (regardless of authentication status)
- Removed from other pages to prevent confusion
- Clean, focused user experience

### **Admin-Only Guided Project Submission**
- **Only appears on `/guided-projects` page** for authenticated admin users
- Styled as outline button to differentiate from regular uploads
- Links to `/upload?type=guided` with special parameters

## ✅ **Role-Based Access Control**

### **Upload Page Security**
1. **Authentication Required**: Redirects to home if not logged in
2. **Admin-Only Guided Projects**: 
   - Checks URL parameter `?type=guided`
   - Shows access restriction page for non-admin users
   - Only admins can submit guided projects

### **User Experience Updates**
- **Dynamic Page Titles**: Changes based on upload type
- **Admin Alerts**: Special notification for guided project submissions
- **Access Denied Page**: Professional handling of unauthorized access

## 📋 **Implementation Details**

### **Header Component Updates**
```typescript
// Regular upload - Library page only
{currentPath === '/library' && (
  <Link to="/upload">Upload Project</Link>
)}

// Admin guided projects - Guided projects page only
{currentPath === '/guided-projects' && isAuthenticated && user?.role === 'admin' && (
  <Link to="/upload?type=guided">Submit Guided Project</Link>
)}
```

### **Upload Page Security**
```typescript
// Authentication check
if (!isAuthenticated || !user) {
  return <Navigate to="/" replace />;
}

// Admin-only guided projects
if (isGuidedProject && user.role !== 'admin') {
  return <AccessDeniedPage />;
}
```

## ✅ **Features Working**
- ✅ Proper button visibility logic
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ URL parameter handling
